The most suitable way to define objects is susing object literals.

const myObject = {
  property: 'Value!',
  otherProperty: 77,
  "obnoxious property": function() {
    // do stuff!
 }
}
One can access information using the dot notation and the bracket notation.
/.dot notation: myObject.property 
//bracket notation myObject['obnoxious proeprty']

Object Constructors
Used to duplicate specific type of objects such as inventory items.
It is mainly a function using the 'this'Key word.
All objects in JavaScript have a prototype. Stated simply, the prototype is another object that the original object inherits from, which is to say, the original object has access to all of its prototypeâ€™s methods and properties.


wasnt able to study object constructors today.
